# Linked-List
## Theory
A LinkedList is a fundamental data structure in computer science, representing a collection of nodes where each node holds data and a reference to the next node in the sequence. This structure allows for dynamic memory allocation, making it well-suited for scenarios where the size of the data set may change over time. Unlike arrays, LinkedLists do not require contiguous memory locations, enabling efficient insertion and deletion operations. However, accessing elements in a LinkedList can be less efficient than in an array due to the need to traverse the list. This versatility makes LinkedLists a valuable tool for tasks ranging from implementing data structures like stacks and queues to handling large datasets in applications like databases and file systems.
